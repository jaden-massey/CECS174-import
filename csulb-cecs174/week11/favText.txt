I love you so much, you have made
me the happiest person ever, I'm
so lucky to have you in my life. You
are always so caring and loving
and make me feel safe. You've created a
safe space in a place that hasn't felt
the most safe in the past. I love how
similar we are, that we can relate to
almost everything so that I feel less
lonely and feel like I am heard. I love
how you challenge me to become a
better person by reminding me and
by setting goals and boundaries.
I love that you want to talk things
out. I love everything about you. I
hope that we can be together forever
because I don't think I could ever
find a person as amazing as you. I
love you fishstick <3
